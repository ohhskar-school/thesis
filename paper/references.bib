Moreover, we survey how text entry errors were handled in these studies.

Governmental guidelines have been developed as a resource for workstation set-up to minimize this risk. The degree of worksite compliance with guidelines has not been examined. The purpose of this study was to examine workstations using the VDT Workstation Checklist to determine compliance, and potential modifications. METHODS: Subjects were recruited from a variety of work settings in Erie, PA. Workstations were assessed with the worker present, using the VDT Workstation Checklist. Adjustments and recommendations were made as appropriate. RESULTS: Of the 60 workstations examined, 48\%did not receive a passing score. All but one were correctable to an acceptable level with minimal low-cost modifications. The recommendation for wrist rests (43\%), changes in monitor height (30\%) or position (27\%) and reposition of the keyboard (13.3\%) and mouse (13.3\%) were the most frequent modifications. Ten (16.7\%) workstations did not require modification. CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of workstations reviewed were not in compliance with current guidelines, however almost all (98\%) could be brought into compliance with simple modifications. Office workers need guidance in setting up workspace and adjusting ergonomic equipment to provide comfortable and safe work settings and minimize musculoskeletal symptoms. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Use of the alphabetic keyboard requires considerable mental processing. Comparison of different keyboard layouts by computer simulation of expert typing shows suprisingly little effect of keyboard arangement for a wide class of keyboards. Performance with some alphabetic layouts is quite slow, but with others, it is with 2\% of the speed achieved when using the Sholes keyboard. Performance with the Dvorak keyboard is not improved by about 5\% over performance on the Sholes keyboard. The conclusion is that is is not worthwhile to use alphabetic keyboards for novice typists, nor to change to the Dvorak layout for experts. Keyboards can probably be improved, but only through radical redesign of the present physical key configuration. Refs.},

	abstract = {Background: Although there has been extensive research about the kinematics of the neck, arm, and wrist during computer keyboarding, there is almost no information concerning the kinematics of the fingers, thumbs, and hands. The purpose of this descriptive study was to establish normative values of the kinematics of the fingers and hands during computer keyboard use. Methods: This study describes the angles, angular velocities, and angular accelerations of the metacarpophalangeal joints and proximal interphalangeal joints for the right and left hands of 20 computer keyboard users during a word-processing task. A new kinematic variable for computer keyboard use, hand/wrist displacement, is also defined and examined. Hand/wrist displacement refers to the translational movements of the hands in which the entire hand is repositioned to strike the keys. Kinematics of both hands of the keyboard users were captured using a three-dimensional motion capture system. Findings: Metacarpophalangeal joint kinematics in flexion/extension and abduction/adduction are reported during typing. Proximal interphalangeal joint kinematics in flexion/extension are also reported. The means and standard deviations for finger postures, velocities and acceleration were generally not significantly different between the right and left hands, with the exception of the 1st digit (thumb). Hand/wrist displacement was significantly different between the right and left hands for side to side movements. Differences in kinematics among the fingers are discussed in view of their potential to be a risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders. Interpretation: This study establishes baseline understanding of the kinematics of computer keyboard use. This information will be useful in future studies of potential risk factors associated with keyboard use. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the relative impact of ultra-low travel keyboards on typing force, muscle activity, wrist posture, typing performance, and self-reported comfort/preference as compared to a conventional keyboard. In a repeated-measures laboratory-based study, 20 subjects were invited to type for 10 min on each of five keyboards with different travel distances of 0.5, 0.7, 1.2, 1.6 (ultra-low travel keyboards), and 2.0 mm (a conventional keyboard). During the typing sessions, we measured typing force; muscle activity in extrinsic finger muscles (flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor digitorum communis), shoulder (trapezius) and neck (splenius capitis); wrist posture; typing performance; and self-reported comfort/preference. While using the ultra-low travel keyboards, subjects typed with less force and wrist extension, and had more ulnar deviation (p's {\textless} 0.0001) compared with conventional keyboard. However, these differences in typing forces were less than 0.5 N and less than 4° for both wrist extension and ulnar deviation. The general trend of data did not show any consistent or substantial differences in muscle activity (less than 2 \%MVC) and typing performance ({\textless}5 WPM in speed; {\textless} 3\% in accuracy), despite the observed statistical difference in the finger flexors and extensors muscle activity (p's {\textless} 0.19) and typing performance (p {\textless} 0.0001). However, the subjects preferred using conventional keyboards in most of the investigated self-reported comfort and preference criteria (p's {\textless} 0.4). In conclusion, these small differences indicate that using ultra-low travel keyboards may not have substantial differences in biomechanical exposures and typing performance compared to conventional keyboard; however, the subjective responses indicated that the ultra-low keyboards with the shortest key travel tended to be the least preferred. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

A marker-based motion analysis system was used to capture digit movements during typing and digit joint angles, angular velocities, and angular accelerations were calculated. Results showed significant differences between the ergonomic and standard keyboard configurations for digit angles, angular velocity, and angular acceleration, particularly for the left metacarpophalangeal joints. Most notably, the ergonomic configuration tended to reduce the angular velocity and acceleration for metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal flexion/extension and increase these variables for metacarpophalangeal abduction/adduction. The participants showed no significant differences in typing speed and error rate between the two keyboards. This research supports other research, which suggests that an ergonomic configuration can alter keyboard kinematics, but suggests that researchers should evaluate not only the wrist kinematics, but the digit kinematics as well.

	abstract = {Fine motor skills like typing involve a mapping problem that trades Fitts' law against Hick's law. Eight fingers have to be mapped onto 26 keys. Movement time increases with distance, so Fitts' law is optimized by recruiting more fingers. Choice difficulty increases with the number of alternatives, so Hick's law is optimized by recruiting fewer fingers. The effect of the number of alternatives decreases with consistent practice, so skilled typists achieve a balance between Fitts' law and Hick's law through learning. We tested this hypothesis by comparing standard typists who use the standard QWERTY mapping consistently with nonstandard typists who use fewer fingers less consistently. Typing speed and accuracy were lower for nonstandard typists, especially when visual guidance was reduced by removing the letters from the keys or covering the keyboard. Regression analyses showed that accommodation to Fitts' law (number of fingers) and Hick's law (consistency) predicted typing speed and accuracy. We measured the automaticity of typing in both groups, testing for hierarchical control in 3 tasks: word priming, which measures parallel activation of keystrokes, keyboard recall, which measures explicit knowledge of letter locations, and hand cuing, which measures explicit knowledge of which hand types which letter. Standard and nonstandard typists showed similar degrees of hierarchical control in all 3 tasks, suggesting that nonstandard typists type as automatically as standard typists, but their suboptimal balance between Fitts' law and Hick's law limits their ability to type quickly and accurately. © 2016 American Psychological Association.},

	abstract = {Prolonged static posture has been identified as a major risk factor for work-related neck and upper limb disorders (WRNULD) in computer users. Previous research has mainly examined working postures in healthy pain-free individuals. The present study examined whether symptomatic subjects exhibited the same kinematic patterns as asymptomatic controls during a prolonged computer task. In a Case-Control comparison, female office workers performed the same computer task using the same adjustable computer workstation for 1 h. Three-dimensional (3D) kinematics were measured in the head-neck, thorax and shoulder (upper arm) segments. Case Group subjects (n=21) displayed trends for increased head-neck flexion angles and greater ranges of movements than the Control Group (n=17). There were also small but significant differences between groups in side flexion and rotation angles of the head-neck region. The shoulder joints displayed significantly greater flexion and abduction angles on the right in both groups, although no group differences were observed. The increased neck flexion angles were associated with significantly higher activity in the upper trapezius muscle and with neck and shoulder discomfort. The individual differences in postural habits appeared to be independent of the physical environment. These results suggest motor control changes are associated with the presence of WRNULD. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our goal is to characterise the majority of present-day users who are untrained and employ diverse, self-taught techniques. In a transcription task, we compare self-taught typists and those that took a touch typing course. We report several differences in performance, gaze deployment and movement strategies. The most surprising finding is that self-taught typists can achieve performance levels comparable with touch typists, even when using fewer fingers. Motion capture data exposes 3 predictors of high performance: 1) unambiguous mapping (a letter is consistently pressed by the same finger), 2) active preparation of upcoming keystrokes, and 3) minimal global hand motion. We release an extensive dataset on everyday typing behavior.},

	abstract = {Background. A prospective study of computer users was performed to determine the occurrence of and evaluate risk factors for neck or shoulder (N/S) and hand or arm (H/A) musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) and disorders (MSD). Methods. Individuals (n = 632) newly hired into jobs requiring ≥ 15 hr/week of computer use were followed for up to 3 years. At study entry, workstation dimensions and worker postures were measured and medical and psychosocial risk factors were assessed. Daily diaries were used to document work practices and incident MSS. Those reporting MSS were examined for specific MSD. Incidence rates of MSS and MSD were estimated with survival analysis. Cox regression models were used to evaluate associations between participant characteristics at entry and MSS and MSD. Results. The annual incidence of N/S MSS was 58 cases/100 person-years and of N/S MSD was 35 cases/100 person-years. The most common N/S MSD was somatic pain syndrome. The annual incidence of H/A MSS was 39 cases/100 person-years and of H/A MSD was 21 cases/100 person-years. The most common H/A disorder was deQuervain's tendonitis. Forty-six percent of N/S and 32\% of H/A MSS occurred during the first month of follow-up. Gender, age, ethnicity, and prior history of N/S pain were associated with N/S MSS and MSD. Gender, prior history of H/A pain, prior computer use, and children at home were associated with either H/A MSS or MSD. Conclusions. H/A and N/S MSS and MSD were common among Computer users. More than 50\% of computer users reported MSS during the first year after starting a new job. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The alternative keyboards tested had the QWERTY layout of keys and were of three designs: split fixed angle, split adjustable angle, and vertically inclined (tilted or tented). When set up correctly, commercially available split keyboards reduced mean ulnar deviation of the right and left wrists from 12 degrees to within 5 degrees of a neutral position compared with a conventional keyboard. The finding that split keyboards place the wrist closer to a neutral posture in the radial/ulnar plane substantially reduces one occupational risk factor of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs): ulnar deviation of the wrist. Applications of this research include commercially available computer keyboard designs that typists can use and ergonomists can recommend to their clients in order to minimize wrist ulnar deviation from typing.},

	abstract = {Passive optical motion capture is one of the predominant technologies for capturing high fidelity human skeletal motion, and is a workhorse in a large number of areas such as bio-mechanics, film and video games. While most state-of-the-art systems can automatically identify and track markers on the larger parts of the human body, the markers attached to fingers provide unique challenges and usually require extensive manual cleanup. In this work we present a robust online method for identification and tracking of passive motion capture markers attached to the fingers of the hands. The method is especially suited for large capture volumes and sparse marker sets of 3 to 10 markers per hand. Once trained, our system can automatically initialize and track the markers, and the subject may exit and enter the capture volume at will. By using multiple assignment hypotheses and soft decisions, it can robustly recover from a difficult situation with many simultaneous occlusions and false observations (ghost markers). We evaluate the method on a collection of sparse marker sets commonly used in industry and in the research community. We also compare the results with two of the most widely used motion capture platforms: Motion Analysis Cortex and Vicon Blade. The results show that our method is better at attaining correct marker labels and is especially beneficial for real-time applications.},

Gestures furthermore play an important role in our daily interactions, and humans are particularly skilled at perceiving and interpreting detailed signals in communications. Creating believable hand motions for virtual characters is an important and challenging task. Many new methods have been proposed in the Computer Graphics community within the last years, and significant progress has been made towards creating convincing, detailed hand and finger motions. This state of the art report presents a review of the research in the area of hand and finger modeling and animation. Starting with the biological structure of the hand and its implications for how the hand moves, we discuss current methods in motion capturing hands, data-driven and physics-based algorithms to synthesize their motions, and techniques to make the appearance of the hand model surface more realistic. We then focus on areas in which detailed hand motions are crucial such as manipulation and communication. Our report concludes by describing emerging trends and applications for virtual hand animation.},

Despite imperfectness of results due to the scenes never following our prior models exactly, Computer Vision has achieved a significant progress in the past two decades. This talk will outline the quest of 3D Computer Vision by describing a processing pipeline that receives a heap of unorganized images from unknown cameras and produces a consistent 3D geometric model together with camera calibrations. We will see how new algorithms allow the standard conception of the pipeline as a series of independent processing steps gradually transform to a single complex, yet efficient vision task.

	abstract = {Two border following algorithms are proposed for the topological analysis of digitized binary images. The first one determines the surroundness relations among the borders of a binary image. Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of 1-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used.},

	doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-46448-0_2},
	abstract = {We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For \$300{\textbackslash}times 300\$ input, SSD achieves 72.1\% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for \$500{\textbackslash}times 500\$ input, SSD achieves 75.1\% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

We then prove that a simple test added to the stopping condition of Douglas-Peucker-like algorithms can guarantee that the resulting simplified polyline is topologically consistent with itself and with all of its neighboring features, and is correctly situated topologically with respect to all other features. We describe how a dynamically updated convex hull data structure may be used to efficiently detect and remove potential topological conflicts of the polyline with itself and with other features in that polyline's neighborhood.},
